# Happy Birthday Gabriel!

Wow, you made it.  Another whole year.  Good job eating, sleeping, and breathing.  If you hadn't done those, I'm not sure if you would have made it.

I was thinking about when you played the drums for me and how good you were.  You had pretty much just started, I think.  I can't wait to see how you're doing now.  Here is a fun [drum video without any drums](https://youtu.be/A_kloG2Z7tU?si=BCKEFAqdrqylBztx).



I decided to try out some features of my art program.  Since you can draw so much better than me I thought I would go with funny.

# A poem

Once upon time, there was a nice lad.\
He had a brother, two sisters, a mom, and a dad.

He could draw awesome dragons and write about them, too.\
There were so many cool things that this guy could do.

Then one day as he was strolling along,\
He felt the beating of wings, so fierce and quite strong.

A water dragon landed, he feared an attack!\
"Sup bro," said the dragon, "please hop on my back."

And so he climbed on and held its scales tight,\
Then, they flew up and right out of sight.

"I need your help," said the dragon, as they soared through the sky\
"I don't know if I can, but I guess I can try."

Soon they landed on an island that was quite deserted.\
"That was totally awesome!" the young lad then blurted.

"The problem, said the dragon "is that we're getting old.\
There's less than a dozen of us now, all told."

"What can I do?" The boy wondered aloud.\
"Please share the art skills with which you've been endowed"

The dragon motioned towards a table by the mouth of his cave\
Our boy walked right up being helpful and brave.

On the table were markers and papers and pencils\
There were really all sorts of drawing utensils.

"Please draw a new dragon for us" the scaly one said.\
So the lad picked up a pencil and went right ahead.

Soon he was done with his brand new creation,\
the dragon then gasped with a puff of elation.

He took the page from the boy and flew up to a peak\
then the ground started to rumble, then next came a shriek.

He then just couldn't believe his eyes,\
As his creation began to materialize.

Then both dragons landed, the old, and the new.\
"Thank you so much, want to do another few?"

Soon many new dragons were flying around,\
and they all made their way to the boy on the ground

"You've added a special part to our magic,\
your imagination has quite done the trick"

"We'd best get you home so you don't get in trouble,\
the boy hopped on his back and they went off on the double"

"I don't know how we can thank you" he said as he landed.\
"I don't need a thing" the young boy remanded.

"Well please accept this" and produced some gold,\
It was quite a large bar for the boy to behold.

"Well all right" said the lad with a shrug,\
"But, I don't really need it, I'll just take a hug"

So they had a nice hug and then after a while,\
the dragon stepped back and gave a quick smile.

"Are you sure there's nothing I can give you, then?"\
"Maybe we can just go flying again?"

# :feet: A message from Finley :feet:

Finley was remembering when he visited your house.  He said you gave him treats and that you took some nice pictures of him.  He was hoping he could do another photoshoot with you the next time he sees you.  He is very good at posing.  Here he is with an origami dog sitting on his head.  And yes, that is real money.
