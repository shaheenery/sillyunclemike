# Happy Birthday Adelina!

You did a good job growing another year older.  Your mom told me that you like working in the garden and growing veggies and flowers.  I'm glad I was able to bring you donuts from Marge's Donut Den to help YOU grow.  It is like plant food for nieces and nephews.  I remember that on Kayak Day, you were always very interested in the snacks that we brought along.  It seems like your a natural at keeping things healthy and fed. :smile: (Oh my goodness, I just learned I can put emoji's right into your birthday card.) :cherry_blossom: :tulip: :rose: :hibiscus: :blossom: :bouquet: 

Please ask your mom and dad to take a picture of you when you are doing some gardening.  Otherwise, I just have to pretend this is you:

I told the computer to make "a tall skinny 11 year old girl with long brown hair, wearing a pink apron tending a vegetable garden."  I think you look pretty good.  Look at the size of that pepper, it's like the same size as the pumpkin, good job! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:



## So I was waiting for dance class to start...

and I decided to start writing you a letter.



Dear Adelina,

I hope you have such a Happy Birthday.  The next time I visit Michigan I will bring an Extra Super De-Duper Birthday HugÂ®, to be given at a time and place of your choosing.  You may want it to be outside, because there might be some spins involved, if you want. (It's *your* birthday hug, so you get to decide.)

As you get older every year I am always excited to see how much you grow and change.  You were doing amazing gymnastics before and now your mom tells me that you like to spend time in the garden and you even made your own apron.  That's really cool that you can grow flowers and veggies.  I tried to grow strawberries one year, but I didn't get any strawberries. :cry:

It seems to me like gardening or farming takes patience, care, and attention to detail.  Those are all great qualities and you should be proud of.  I'm proud to be your uncle.

Love,

Uncle Mike



## :feet: A message from Finley :feet:

Finley told me the other day that he was thinking about the time when you were doing the back-bend bridge thing and he ran right under you.  That was pretty exciting.  I told him that you like to grow vegetables and he got really excited.  Finley is my veggie buddy, whenever he hears me making a salad, he pitter-patters right over because he knows I'll share some lettuce, cucumbers :cucumber: , and carrots :carrot: with him.  He said he would like to try something that you grow.  

I decided to ask Aunt Tracey to take a picture of me sharing a sugar snap pea with Finley.  It's kinda like Lady and the Tramp, we just didn't kiss.  I think it came out pretty good.  I think our noses actually booped when he went in for the chomp.

Your mom told me that Caleb asked for everyone to give him a silly face after I mentioned that in my card.  I think for you, tell everyone that I said that have to do a special high-five with you.  Maybe its a "behind the back" or maybe its "two fist bumps and a clap explosion."  



## Without Further Ado...

Your Birthday Card
