## Some Words to Read

Dear Caleb, I'm wishing you the most happiest of birthdays from over here in California.  I hope you have a really fun day filled with lots of smiles and laughs.  Tell your mom, dad, and siblings (and maybe grandparents) that I said they have to make a silly face for you.  Here's mine:

I love you, nephew, and I look forward to the next time we can be together.  I'll have an Extra Special Birthday HugÂ® in store for you.  Keep practicing at Mario Kart.  I hope you can beat me the next time we play.

## Special Message from Finley

Hi Caleb, when I'm laying in my wolf den under the bed, sometimes I think back to all the fun we had in Michigan.  Thank you for playing with me and giving me treats.  Those are my two favorite things.  I told your Uncle Mike to give you a hug for me next time he see's you, because you know, my stumpy arms don't work like that.

Love,

Finley
