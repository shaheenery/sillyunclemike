# Happy Birthday Chiara!

Happy Laaaaaaaaaaaaate Birthday

On one hand, your online birthday card is late, very late.  Very very very very very very veeeeeeerrrrryyyy late.  On the other hand, you are the first nibling to get an online birthday card!

You know what?  Let's call it an online birthday digital multimedia experience extravaganza, that has a nice ring to it.  It just sort of rolls off the tongue.
## A silly little poem

There once was a girl named Chiara

she had a cute pet capybara.

Her silly Uncle Mike started to run out of rhymes;

so they just ate pasta marinara.

## Have I Mentioned I am a Great Artist?

You probably don't remember, because it has been like a hundred years since we saw each other, but I actually have amazing drawing skills.  See, here is your amazing card

## From Finley

Finley also wanted to wish you a happy birthday.  He just turned seven years old.  Here he is with his friend Ginger.  As you can see, his hair is sticking out of her mouth.
